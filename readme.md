# Project Knowledge Base!
Welcome <br>
This is a website where I will post all knowledge that I gain in my journey to learn computer sceince in simple words <br>
It would also contain links to very good articles. <br>

## Access the site
Live: https://xxx-insane-xxx.github.io/project_knowledge_base/ <br>

## Goal
The end goal is to convert this basic website to a webapp inspired by todo lists format where I can update my content from the website itself. Like some fully functioal blogging website where everything will be done within website instead of editing the html to write the contents
